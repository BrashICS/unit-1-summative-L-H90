        James Gosling is known as the “Father of Java”, as he was the main inventor of the Javascript computing language and implemented its original compiler and virtual machine. Javascript created the foundation of web development, as it enabled developers to create imaginative and interactive websites. Due to James Gosling, most web developers go-to is Javascript to this day when making complicated and well structured websites. He also built a multi processor version of Unix for a 16-way computer system.
